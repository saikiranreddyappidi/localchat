# localchat
This is like whatsapp but it works in local network.It is useful to share information within the local network without internet.
In this there is currently no encryption used to encrypt the messages and they are directly store in database tables with sender and receiver information
It identifies the user in the local network primarily based on cookies set by the server and on IP address of the client computer.
It is currently under development.
